                <dd>The Sounders won their first MLS Cup in Franchise history in 2016, over the same team, Toronto FC.
                    They were second in the standings in the Western Conference after the regular season, having an
                    advantage once the play offs began. Their offense was unstoppable, averaging 3 goals a game and only
                    1.75 goals scored against them.

                <dd>The Houston Astros were defeated in the 2019 World Series by the Washington Nationals. Although, in
                    2017 when the Astros won the World Series, there is rumor that they were cheating. Reportedly, they
                    had a camera in center field that would look at the signs that catcher was giving the pitcher,
                    making that batter know what pitch is coming. Their batting averages at home vs away were
                    drastically different. </p>
