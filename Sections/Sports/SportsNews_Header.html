                <h2>Breaking News</h2>
                <dd>The Houston Astros were defeated in the 2019 World Series by the Washington Nationals. Although, in 2017 when the Astros won the World Series, there is rumor that they were cheating. Reportedly, they had a camera in center field that would look at the signs that catcher was giving the pitcher, making that batter know what pitch is coming. Their batting averages at home vs away were drastically different. </dd>
